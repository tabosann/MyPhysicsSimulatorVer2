# MyPhysicsSimulatorVer2
Let me apologize for my poor English. 
I have been creating the MyPhysics Engine for 7 months by myself.
This engine uses below under win32.
- DX12
- Dear ImGui
- DirectXTex
And this engine runs under below circumstances.
- DirectXTex_Desktop_2019_Win10.sln ran.
- imgui_impl_win32.h / .cpp
- imgui_impl_dx12.h / .cpp
This engine uses files that ImGui offers, they are in ImGui folder, and d3dx12.h that DirectXTex offers.
I uses DirectXTex project under DirectXTex_Desktop_2019_Win10.sln. For more details, refer to xxx.com.
